DC Comics' Parasite
=======================================================================
Version: 2.2 (1/2/2012)

Created by Buyog2099 and Jet the Phoenix, with help from pretty much the entire Scruffy Dragon team, for the MUGEN DC vs Marvel project

	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	Things that will hack me off related to the use of this character:
	- Don't host it on your site unless you ASK me first, and give me
		proper credit. Email isn't hard, and I'll probably say yes,
		so don't be afraid to ask. =P
	- If you got this character from somewhere other than ScruffyDragon.com 
		or my site, Buyog.com, it's quite possible that it's been hacked and/or modified
		without my permission, and not all the moves and animations may be very good.
		Best to get it from a trusted source and be confident in its integrity.

PROFILE
----------------------------------

Rudy Jones was a simple man, a janitor for S.T.A.R. Labs, who made the mistake 
of thinking he could open a radioactive waste container to steal something 
valuable. Instead, the radiation transformed him into a monster with an 
insatiable appetite for human life force. When he learned he could also gain 
knowledge and abilities from his victims, well, all the better -- and when he 
found Superman, he knew he'd hit the jackpot.

Over the years, Rudy's also picked up the ability to feed off of other sources 
of energy, like heat and light, and to retain the powers he steals for longer 
periods of time. 


GAMEPLAY
----------------------------------

Parasite's got the typical "Capcom Versus" 6-button play style:
x - Weak Punch (WP)
y - Medium Punch (MP)
z - Hard Punch (HP)
a - Weak Kick (WK)
b - Medium Kick (MK)
c - Hard Kick (HK)

d,u:    Super Jump (KKK will trigger it too)
f,f:    Dash Forward
b,b:    Dash Back


NOTE
Rudy was originally developed on WinMUGEN, but this release sees him updated to 
support MUGEN 1.0. He should work fine in both environments; if you have issues, let me know.


SPECIALS
----------------------------------

 - Projectile Absorb: WP+WK
	Rudy catches any incoming projectile, if he can (not all projectiles are absorbable), 

 - Feeding Time: QCB + P/K
	Rudy dashes forward to grab P2. If he connects, he drains some of his opponent's health, 
	as well as any special powers, energy, or skills that person possesses.

 - Stolen Power (varies): QCF + P/K
	Rudy activates whatever special attack is associated with his current power set
    (or, if he hasn't got a special in that power set, he'll complain to you about it)

 - Feeding Frenzy (air or ground): HP+WK or WP+HK
	Simple dash attack where you try to jump your opponent by surprise and drain their lifeforce away; 
	whatever lifeforce you manage to steal adds to your power bar.

	
HYPERS
----------------------------------

 - (lvl1) Stolen Power (varies): QCF + PP/KK
	Rudy activates whatever hyper is associated with his current power set
    (or, if he hasn't got a hyper in that power set, he'll complain to you about it)

 - (lvl1) Quick Snack: QCB + PP/KK
    Rudy dashes offscreen to get a new power to replace one he's already got

 - (lvl3) Power Overload: F,D,DF + punch & kick of equal strength
    Rudy crouches down, pulling all of the ambient power he can draw, then jumps up and lets it all go 
    in a single, damaging burst


POWER SYSTEM
----------------------------------

Near the bottom of the screen you'll notice two overlapping "mouths" that 
represent the two power slots that can be filled by other character's moves: 
one is filled and activated with the punch buttons, the other with the kicks.
The slots are pre-filled at the start of the first round with a couple of 
random powers, but these can be changed. A slot is filled when Rudy connects a 
Feeding Time attack and has sufficient time to drain his opponent's energy; he 
then gains at least one special move and one hyper for that character, and 
sometimes other bonuses as well (for example, the Spider-Man power set allows 
him to wall-jump, and Superman's power set lets him fly). However, you may also 
get that character's weakness... like Superman's susceptibility to Kryptonite!
For the current list of power sets and their properties, see the POWER SETS 
section further down the page.


COMBO SYSTEM
----------------------------------

Capcom-style chain combos work for standing, crouching, and air:
1. WP+MP+SP: you can chain the three punches together, weakest to strongest, for a 3 hit combo.
2. WK+MK+SK: like the punches, you can chain the three kicks together as well.
3. (in air) WP+WK+MP+MK+SP: The basic "zigzag" combo. Chains up to 6 hits.

Launcher: Crouching HP

CREDITS
----------------------------------

Rudy owes a lot to other creators who have graciously allowed me to mimic (and in some cases copy) their characters' moves.
Likewise, many people have lent images, ideas, and sprites that all contribute to the character as he is today; this 
character would not have been possible without them.
Here are some of the people that have really gone out of their way to help me out... if I've missed you, I'm sorry! 
Let me know and I'll credit you in the next release.
