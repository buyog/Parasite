$ Super-Skrull: I can kind of punt here, and just cough up a random FF poweret :)
% War Machine: maybe I can just treat him like Iron Man?
^ X-23: I might be able to get away with just treating her like Wolverine...

@ ... and then there's Rogue. I really have no idea how to deal with the Rogues out there (ranked easiest to hardest):
- ignore her / treat her like an unpowered opponent (random health/power boost)
- treat her like MarvelTemplate, and just give a random Marvel powerset?
- create a custom powerset based on her few non-power-drain moves?
- try and figure out what power set she's got and copy it? (ugh, HARD)

Amalgam, as envisioned by Danilokao:
    - After the transformation, Plague teleports to enemy's back and punches, 
    sending him to the middle of the screen, 
    - so Plague traps him with Venom's tendrils, then unleash the "power frenzy" combo: 
        - Splits in two (Lobo) then both attacks alternate 
        - Heat vision, freeze ray, GL uppercut, aerial Sandspin...
        - enemy falls to the ground 
        - then thanos geokinesis throws him back to the air at the middle of the screen, 
        - Sinestro's chains tie him up 
        - then Plague jumps to him and explodes, turning back to parasite.

Note on Omega Red (per AC):
    you could have a passive Healing Factor, and maybe implement the Death Spores as a double whammy.
    The special releases 'death spores' which cling to the opponent, slowing them down and draining a SMALL amount of life. Each spore clings for say...a few seconds.
    The hyper could be something like 'Unlock Spore Potential', which would have each spore on the opponent deal a large multiplier of damage. In theory, enough spores on the opponent, could be a one hit kill...but say that'd take...10-12.
    Therefore , the spore release could be tied to the strength of attack used. Weak = 1, medium = 2, strong = 3.

  x "projectile absorption" special: he can "absorb fast-moving objects' inertia" (see Wikipedia)
  x "power overload" hyper
  - finish/debug a subset of his power sets:
        Superman: Speed Fury, fix flight, better heat vision effect? (from Kon-el for now)
        Wonder Woman: Fierce Amazon, fix hyper
        Flash: Speed Force
        Lobo: RotGut
        Plastic Man: Stone Fists         All basic attacks have extended range

Ideas:
- power-combo attacks:
  - ice+crystal = elemental storm
  - lobo+spiderman: maximum spidermen?
  

SethZantuken ideas (12/31/2005):
    Well you know he can absorb "Energy" also besides Life force
    So for his Own Hypers make him absorb like heat or electricity or grab the ground and absorb from that.
    You can do some wicked stuff that way

    So like he could have a charge command HOLD punch+kick and he absorbs energy around him then he can release it
    Or say he absorbs the ground.... have him grow a bit and charge at the enemy...Nero Chaos style

    Parasite pretty much is Absorbing man

DaBanner ideas (12/28/2005):
    I know parasite copies hypers but for a secret ultimate hyper. How about he grabs Superman out
    of the blue and absorbs so much of his power he mutates into a larger version of himself and
    does a a quick one-two knockout punch. in the vein of what strong guy does with his level 3 mass punch.

DaBanner ideas (12/31/2005):
    actually i asked the question the wrong way,i meant to ask if parasite when he touches
    the enemy,if he would be able to do the opponent's ultimate hypers.

    Or if that would be too complicated.

    As far as an ultimate solo hyper for parasite to do. The only move I can see him doing that
    stands out is when in the comic superman returned from the dead he was massively overpowered.
    So he let parasite absorb enough of his energy so that superman came back down to normal
    abilities. While at the same time parasite came out looking larger and looking kind of like the abomination.

    Ultimate Hyper Idea 1
        This is just my idea....i think i told it to you before...in his ultimate hyper you can have
        superman show up in front of parasite threatning to stop him. Superman then just stands
        regally as parasite grabs him and you see superman in a dizzy state as parasite glows with
        energy and you see sparks along with the glow going over parasite as he grows into a larger
        body size with a bit more feral look to him. He then smiles and throws superman away and does
        an autocombo of 6 hits. 3 punches 3 kicks,3rd kick is a an air launcher that sends the charactor
        in the air...then parasite jumps in the air and grabs the opponent like the ending piece of
        captain america's final justice and lands him on his noggin on the way down.

        The energy glow around parasite during the absorbing in the ultimate hyper can be of a red
        color if you want and i thought those little yellow electric bolts during the thor tornado
        hyper can be added to him over his body while the glow is happening,to show the overload in his ability.

    Ultimate hyper idea 2
        If that doesn't work well for you I thought perhaps he could do a superman hyper mix.....
        same procedure occurs where he absorbs superman and overloads. Then he does 2 hard punches and then does first a
        mid air,heatvision blast,then immediately dives down in front of the opponent and does super breath...and for
        the final finale he spins underground and does the bizarro hyper where is digging towards the opponent and
        covered in lava does a rising uppercut.

buddyup2003 idea (10/8/2007):
    I just got another idea. Maybe he can have a special block move used where he absorbs projectile attacks to 
    increase his super bar. I was thinking maybe something similer to the "parry" moves from Street Fighter 3.


Progress:
8/7/2007:
- revamped power sets to align with DCvM Phase1
- added Kon-El TK Lift special (needs sounds)
8/4/2007:
- added Ghost Rider flaming breath special (needs sounds)
5/30/2007:
- more or less finished Omega Blast (Darkseid special)
- better sprites in several key places (e.g. Ice's special)
